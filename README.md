# angular-cipher-dashboard

This is just an angular based dashboard to play around with my other project [angular-cipher-filters](https://github.com/zsoltiii/angular-cipher-filters).

Initial project skeleton was set up with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and showcases the use of modular components called directives.

To jump straight into it try the DEMO.

# Installation

You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) to start, then simply

```bash
npm install
```

This above command runs `bower install` as well so you don't have to.

Start the light-weight [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) with

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and load `http://localhost:8000/app/`.

#TODO

- Add demo to github.io
- Clean up the mess Yeoman created / left behind
- Complete unit and end-to-end tests
- Add more experimental pages
- Add more ciphers
